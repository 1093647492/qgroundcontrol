/// Represent photo collection stored on filesystem
///
/// Manages a collection of photos stored as files in some filesystem. It
/// provides facilities to list, retrieve, add, modify and remove files. Its
/// raison d'Ãªtre is to
/// - provide notifiers about changes to store such that* different actors can
///   have a consistent view. (NB: does///not* imply thread synchronization --
///   assuming to be accessed from main GUI thread only), and
/// - manage assigning ids to incoming files
///
/// The store presently does not manage folders/sub-directories. This is a
/// feature that could be added, although it might be preferrable from GUI
/// perspective to use "tags" independent of physical storage location for
/// grouping.
///
/// Another feature that is not fully clear whether this is the best place is
/// synchronization with external storage -- might go here or elsewhere.
